I finally got around to making a website for my company, just a few days before its first anniversary. It took me about 4 months, in total, but that included fairly long periods of not doing anything to it!

The plan for it, other than as an advertisement for my services, is to post helpful hints and tips about coding, as I come across things in the line of work. Hopefully, someone will find it of interest and if not, at least it will serve as a reminder to myself.

At some point, I'll write a post describing the process of creating the site and the reasons behind the decisions I made.
